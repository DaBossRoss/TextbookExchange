================

Since the 1970â€™s, prices in textbooks have risen faster than college tuition.  In the last three decades alone, prices for books have risen by over 812 percent. Students are struggling to pay for the cost of these textbooks as prices are now exeeding $200 per book. Due to these costs we are attempting to circumvent the bookstores by proving a location where students can put their old books up for sale. This will create and foster a market that can hopefully help folks buy textbooks at lower rates and help the sellers gain back something more than what the book stores would offer when returning the books. Sellers and Buyers will only be put into contact with the site as the actually transactions will be worked out amongst themselves. We will simply host the basic information needed to make a decision.
